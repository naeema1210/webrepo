<p>Born on August 15, 1934 in Kudallur, a small village in Palakkad district of Kerala, MT steadily started displaying exceptional creative skills in writing and soon carved a niche for himself through some outstanding novels and short stories in Malayalam. These works had the fine blend of romanticism, and many shades of human life, especially suffering, which he portrayed masterfully. This unique approach to writing made MT popular among the common man, as they found solace in the candid depiction of logical outcomes and simple philosophies of life.

M.T.'s first major novel, Nalukettu was published in 1958 and literally created a stir in Malayalam literature. This masterful literary craftmanship soon got widely acknowledged in the Malayalam literati and is also considered as a revival of a literary tradition initiated by Mr. Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, Mr. Vaikom Muhammed Basheer and Mr. Uroob.
